# Energy_Efficiency_in_Buildings_with_ANFIS
A MATLAB project for evaluating and predicting energy efficiency in buildings using ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System). The project includes MATLAB files (.mat, .fis) for ANFIS modeling and an Excel file containing the results.

This project aims to evaluate the heating and cooling load requirements (energy efficiency) of buildings as a function of building parameters. ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) is used for these predictions using MATLAB.

## Project Description

Energy efficiency in buildings is evaluated as a function of various building parameters. In this study, energy analysis was conducted using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect software. The buildings vary in terms of parameters such as glass area, glass area distribution, and orientation. Various settings of these parameters were simulated to obtain 768 different building shapes. The dataset consists of 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real-valued responses (Heating Load and Cooling Load).

## Files

- `matlab.mat`: MATLAB data file containing the dataset.
- `tahmin.fis`: ANFIS model file for prediction.
- `untitled.fis`: Another ANFIS model file for prediction.
- `anfis_enerji.xlsx`: Excel file containing the results of the energy efficiency analysis.

## Usage

After downloading the project files, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Open MATLAB and load the `matlab.mat` file to access the dataset.
2. Use the `tahmin.fis` or `untitled.fis` files to load the ANFIS models for prediction.
3. Results of the energy efficiency analysis can be found in the `anfis_enerji.xlsx` Excel file.
